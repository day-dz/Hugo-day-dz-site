# Hello!

My name is Jack or Dayds (Day-dz) and I currently work as a Cybersecurity analyst for a National Healthboard.

I have worked within IT since 2021 and within:

- IT Service Desk
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- IAM and exchange automation
- Cybersecurity

Over the past year I have been working on trying to learn more general security principles as my knowledge was very identity focused coming into the job. 


As a side project I'll use this site to showcase some of the things I make and to highlight topics that I find interesting or important.
